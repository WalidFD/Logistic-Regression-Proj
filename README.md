# Logistic-Regression-Proj

Predicting Defaulting Loans With Logistic Regression.

The main objective of the project is to set out a good predictive Model to the extent of its limitations, from the collected existing information on the quality of the loan and improving the profit level with the status of the loans, to set out the various variables of these standards and benchmarks to qualify for a good loan and to extract from it a list of minimum variables to predict a quality standards loans in consideration for approval. The result is intended to improve a better revenue from the loans and be able to make profits while reducing the default loans in the process. The various elements of the project are summarised as follow : 
•	Preparing and Cleaning the Data
•	Exploring and Transforming the Data
•	The Logistic Model
•	Optimizing the Model for Accuracy
•	Optimizing the Threshold for Profit
